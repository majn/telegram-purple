# Rationales (from bottom up):
# - There will always be tags of the style "v1.2.5", so search for that
# - The "beta" group must be non-capturing, otherwise uscan tries to concatenate them (e.g. "1.2.3-beta.-beta")
# - Github tars are unusable; use the (hopefully attached) origtar
# - Beta-releases should be ordered before the "main" release (was never relevant so far)
# - Spacing in order to have exactly one rule per line
