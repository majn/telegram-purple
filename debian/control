Description: Purple plugin to support Telegram
 Plugin for purple which lets you use and manage your Telegram account
 like any other account in purple. Some features like self-destruct
 messages are currently in development.
X-Comment: Traditionally, this plugin should be named "telegram-pidgin".
 However, this plugin is also designed to work with at least Adium,
 Finch, and hopefully all other libpurple-frontends, so this name would
 be highly misleading. Furthermore, the plugin refers to itself as
 "telegram-purple", and changing this (e.g. via a patch) would be highly
 non-trivial and fragile. Finally, several users know this plugin under
 the name telegram-purple only, so naming the Debian package differently
 would be another source of confusion. Thus we intentionally break with
 this tradition, and re-used the name telegram-purple from the original
 project.
